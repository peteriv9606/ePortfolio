                                <p> As part of my "Learning in the Digital Era" module, I was introduced to a previously uknown platform to me called <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn" style="color: dodgerblue;">OpenLearn</a>. In this platform, i was able to learn new and exciting features about the everyday use of technology, to which, quite frankly, I have never payed attention to before. I was assigned a "Digital Plan" - a document in which I can keep track of my progress, as well as my personal points of view, activities, applications and more. The "Digital Plan", as well as my own words aggregate towards the making of this assessment.

                                <hr>
                                <p> This week I've thought about my use of technology and the kinds of things I tend to do at the moment. I've also been introduced to Manuela, Michael and John - my "companions" for this course, and I have found something in common between them and me: They all want to get up to date with technology, same as me. All of them are looking forward to “climbing up the ladder of success”, same as me. They want to learn more skills, same as I do. Using the activities in the platform, i have found that I am an "Appy and Adventurous" digital user, which means that I have embraced technology and social media and use it confidently in all sorts of everyday situations. I may sometimes need to be reminded that face-to-face communication is important too, which is quite true, given the fact that I tend to stay more in front of the screen than to pay attention to what is happening in front of me.</p>
                                <p> One thing we all had to do, was to make a note of our starting point at the beginning of the week, and the most useful thing we’ve learned, one of which is the benefits of being able to use the internet, another one is to identify what the basic digital skills for everyday life are, and the most important one for me was how social networking can be useful to me. I also managed to identify one thing that I’d like to learn more about, and that was to use social media, as a tool to promote my own business, or work I provide. Even though i spend a lot of time online, I haven't had the opportunity to promote myself enough, and that reflects on my business opportunities, or moreover - the lack of them. Spending more time on this module, I took a chance and made a few more profiles in different work-related websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Nextdoor - applications I have never used before. I wasn't sure about any of them, but in the end of the day, my work gave fruit - I found my first client!..when i think about it, she found me, using social media.</p>
                                <p> In order to see what I have learned, I was advised to do an end-of-the week practice Quiz.</p>

                                    <p> In the second week, I had to do several activities. <br>

                                <p>Week 2 has introduced me to the definition of digital skills and how it relates to digital literacy.  I never knew about the framework for digital skills, which divides the key skills needed to be effective online into 5 categories, or the "Jisc" framework (that has 6 categories). Interestingly enough, I learned what "Creative Commons" is, and how and when it is used, as i never thought that when people's creations, you have to give them the propper credit. I have also assessed how confident I am with a number of digital skills, using the activities in the OpenEdu Platform, and judging by the results, I can say, that I am very confident with using my digital skills, as to I did not find anything in particular that captured my interest more than the given information.</p>  
                                <p>One of the activities I had to do in the "Digital Plan" was to choose one environment, and make a note of what skills I think I might need to do things effectively online. Presented by a table, here is what I chose:</p>

                                        <th>While I’m studying, I might need to know…</th>
                                      </tr>
                                      <tr class="weekRow">

                                <p>This week, it's all about the "Digital Me". What is "Digital Footprint"? Is it good? Is it bad? Depending on what you are doing online, you can get to the answer yourself. These are the little breadcrumbs you leave behind when you do anything online. I've learned, that this includes (and is not limited to) profiles such as Facebook and LinkedIn, Photographs of me or tagged photos (on Facebook) and basically, anything about me that is on the web - written, recorded, photographed, etc. I found out, that I am at a good starting point for my "digital footprint" by Googling my name, and only people with the same name as mine come up, but not me.</p>
                                <p>One of the activities this week was to make a note of ways I can create a positive footprint and actions to take if I have a negative one. With the help of my "Digital Plan", I have managed to give myself the following advice:</p>
                                <br>
                                    <i>
                                        <ul class="inWeekList">
                                            <li>Be more cautious about what you are writing on social media;</li>
                                            <li>Don’t put personal information online;</li>
                                            <li>Be more cautious with linked websites (logging in other websites using your Facebook Account or Google account) as they might take more information than required;</li>
                                            <li>Make sure everything you upload is shown to the right people, and not to those that do not need to see your information (Uploading photos that only Friends can see, Removing unnecessary information from LinkedIn, etc.)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </i>
                                <br>
                                <p>The second activity I had to do, was to give advice on how and what to do to develop digital footprint. Here it is:<br><br>
                                    Both you and your friends should be cautious when uploading photos or sensitive information on the web, thus carving your digital footprint. First of all, if you need to create a positive digital footprint, either for work-related stuff, or life representation, you must go and check what information “The Internet” has on you, and you have to make sure, no personal information was uploaded anywhere. You can remove old photos of parties that won’t help you in finding a better job, after your employer finds them online (If your party pictures are online, and they are more than once or twice a week, your employer might think of you as an unorganized and irresponsible person, and might not consider you as a perfect candidate for the job).<br>
                                    Later on, you can update your information about any new courses you have done, or any certificates you have acquired along the way. That is a big plus for you, because it might give a better representation of yourself to your employer, or somebody who is looking to start working with you.<br>On the other hand, you can “un-tag” yourself from embarrassing photos from your friends timelines, so you can skip the mockery at your work place.<br>In other words:  
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                            <li>Search for your own name on the internet to see what comes up.;</li>

                                <p>In week 4 I was able to go more in-depth about online protecting myself, communication with others online, how to manage the time I spend online connected with other people, and the, interestingly new to me thing: Creative Commons licenses.</p>
                                <p>E-Safety is one of the most important things when being online. There are many ways to protect ourselves while being online, but one of the things I found out for me, was that I was not using the "Two-Factor Authentication" while logging-in to my accounts.<br>
                                The second thing I noted down in my "Digital Plan", regarding the techniques of making a strong password, or ways to improve my online security, was to use different passwords for different accounts in order to protect them.<br>
                                If either account gets hacked or otherwise "burnt", other accounts are safe, because hackers cannot use that same cracked password for a different account, as they are secured with different passwords, or a combination of other password and the "Two-Factor Authentication" method for logging-in.</p> 
                                <p>Apart from this, while I was watching a video on how to improve my digital well-being, I made some notes of tips that I wanted to try out. The tips i managed to write were:</p>

                                            <li>Purchase a Fitbit to keep me from standing still in one place for prolonged period of times (to remind myself to go and take a walk, or to go for a run from time to time, or if I have been in one place for a long time).</li>
                                        </ul>

                                <p>A number of steps were taken since the beginning of the lessons I've learned about how to protect myself online, some of which are to use different passwords and to start to use the "Two-Factor Authentication" for logging-in to my accounts, as I have not used these two in the past recently. </p>
                                <p>As usual, this week I had one more quiz, but this time, the quiz was a "Compulsory Badge" quiz, that counts towards my badge. There is a second one at <a style="cursor:pointer; color:#135db1;font-style: italic;" onclick="loadWeek('w8')">Week 8</a>, and for both, I must obtain a score of at least 50% to qualify for the badge.</p>

                                <p>Week 5 gave me the opportunity to gain the ability to think critically. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                                <br>
                                    <i> 
                                        <ul class="inWeekList">
                                            <li>The ability to search effectively by filtering, scamming and skimming through pages to find information more quickly;</li>
                                            <li>Asking the right questions of online sources and setting the criteria to judge who and what can be trusted online;</li>
                                            <li>The ability to deal with "information overload" and to set the right starting points when searching for information online. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </i>
                                <br>
                                <p>To answer the question "How do I decide what to trust online?", I can safely say that my information sources are narrowed down to no more than five to ten websites. For example, if I want to find some information for a program or a website I'm currently having issues with, I would refer to StackOverflow or to W3Schools for answers. If I'm asked to do a report, I would refer to the (online) school library, <a href="http://www.investopedia.com" style="color:#135db1; font-style: italic;">www.investopedia.com</a>, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net" style="color:#135db1; font-style: italic;">www.researchgate.net</a> or <a href="http://www.academia.edu" style="color:#135db1; font-style: italic;">www.academia.edu</a>.</p>
                                <p>I also learned what "information landscape" is, and that helped me with managing my activities for this week, as well as allowing me to see the key features of my own information landscape.<br>
                                    Comparing "Now" and "Six months ago", I can surely say that there is no significant difference between my sources of information<br>
                                    For example:
                                </p>

I've learned that I should use my critical thinking in order to select the most appropriate app or tool, whether for work, studies or at home.</p>
                                <p>Knowing all that, I was asked to describe what applications and tools I use regularly to manage my activities. Refer to the table below:</p>
