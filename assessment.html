                                <p style="font-size: 20px;">As part of my "Learning in the Digital Era" module, I was introduced to a previously uknown platform to me called <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn" style="color: dodgerblue;">OpenLearn</a>.
                                    In this platform, i was able to learn new and exciting features about the everyday use of technology, to which, quite frankly, I have never payed attention to before.
                                    I was assigned a "Digital Plan" - a document in which I can keep track of my progress, as well as my personal points of view, activities, applications and more.
                                    The "Digital Plan", as well as my own words aggregate towards the making of this assessment.

                                <hr>
                                <p> This week I've thought about my use of technology and the kinds of things I tend to do at the moment. I've also been introduced to Manuela, Michael and John - my "companions" for this course, and I have found something in common between them and me:
                                    They all want to get up to date with technology, same as me. All of them are looking forward to “climbing up the ladder of success”, same as me. They want to learn more skills, same as I do. Using the activities in the platform, i have found that I am an "Appy and Adventurous" digital user,
                                    which means that I have embraced technology and social media and use it confidently in all sorts of everyday situations. I may sometimes need to be reminded that face-to-face communication is important too, which is quite true, given the fact that I tend to stay more in front of the screen than to pay attention to what is happening in front of me.
                                </p>
                                <p> One thing we all had to do, was to make a note of our starting point at the beginning of the week, and the most useful thing we’ve learned, one of which is the benefits of being able to use the internet, another one is what the basic digital skills for everyday life are, and the most important one for me was how social networking can be useful to me.
                                    I also managed to identify one thing that I’d like to learn more about, and that was to use social media, as a tool to promote my own business, or work I provide.
                                    Even though i spend a lot of time online, I haven't had the opportunity to promote myself enough, and that reflects on my business opportunities, or moreover - the lack of them. 
                                    Spending more time on this module, I took a chance and made a few more profiles in different work-related websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Nextdoor - applications I have never used before. I wasn't sure about any of them, but in the end of the day, my work gave fruit - I found my first client!..when i think about it, she found me. She had a problem with her PC, and with my knowledge, I was able to quickly solve her issue.
                                </p>
                                <p> In order to see what I have learned, I was advised to do an end-of-the week practice Quiz.
