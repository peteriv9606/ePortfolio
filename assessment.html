                                <p> As part of my "Learning in the Digital Era" module, I was introduced to a previously uknown platform to me called <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn" style="color: dodgerblue;">OpenLearn</a>. In this platform, i was able to learn new and exciting features about the everyday use of technology, to which, quite frankly, I have never payed attention to before. I was assigned a "Digital Plan" - a document in which I can keep track of my progress, as well as my personal points of view, activities, applications and more. The "Digital Plan", as well as my own words aggregate towards the making of this assessment.

                            </div>
                            <div class="week one" id="w1">

                                <div class="weeksubhead">Week 1</div>
                                <hr>
                                <p> This week I've thought about my use of technology and the kinds of things I tend to do at the moment. I've also been introduced to Manuela, Michael and John - my "companions" for this course, and I have found something in common between them and me: They all want to get up to date with technology, same as me. All of them are looking forward to “climbing up the ladder of success”, same as me. They want to learn more skills, same as I do. Using the activities in the platform, i have found that I am an "Appy and Adventurous" digital user, which means that I have embraced technology and social media and use it confidently in all sorts of everyday situations. I may sometimes need to be reminded that face-to-face communication is important too, which is quite true, given the fact that I tend to stay more in front of the screen than to pay attention to what is happening in front of me.</p>
                                <p> One thing we all had to do, was to make a note of our starting point at the beginning of the week, and the most useful thing we’ve learned, one of which is the benefits of being able to use the internet, another one is to identify what the basic digital skills for everyday life are, and the most important one for me was how social networking can be useful to me. I also managed to identify one thing that I’d like to learn more about, and that was to use social media, as a tool to promote my own business, or work I provide. Even though i spend a lot of time online, I haven't had the opportunity to promote myself enough, and that reflects on my business opportunities, or moreover - the lack of them. Spending more time on this module, I took a chance and made a few more profiles in different work-related websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Nextdoor - applications I have never used before. I wasn't sure about any of them, but in the end of the day, my work gave fruit - I found my first client!..when i think about it, she found me, using social media.</p>
                                <p> In order to see what I have learned, I was advised to do an end-of-the week practice Quiz.

                                    <p> In the second week, I had to do several activities. <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                                As week 2 was very close to the date I arrived in the UK, I was quicly able to solve this one by using a table in the "Digital Plan", which you can see below:

                                 <p>Week 2 has introduced me to the definition of digital skills and how it relates to digital literacy.  I never knew about the framework for digital skills, which divides the key skills needed to be effective online into 5 categories, or the "Jisc" framework (that has 6 categories). Interestingly enough, I learned what "Creative Commons" is, and how and when it is used, as i never thought that when people's creations, you have to give them the propper credit. I have also assessed how confident I am with a number of digital skills, using the activities in the OpenEdu Platform, and judging by the results, I can say, that I am very confident with using my digital skills, as to I did not find anything in particular that captured my interest more than the given information.</p>  
                                 <p>One of the activities I had to do in the "Digital Plan" was to choose one environment, and make a note of what skills I think I might need to do things effectively online. Presented by a table, here is what I chose:
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <table class="weekActivity">
                                    <tr class="weekRow">
                                        <th>At home I might need to know…</th>
                                        <th>At work, I might need to know…</th>
                                        <th>While I’m studying, I might need to know…</th>
                                      </tr>
                                      <tr class="weekRow">

                                <p>This week, it's all about the "Digital Me". What is "Digital Footprint"? Is it good? Is it bad? Depending on what you are doing online, you can get to the answer yourself. These are the little breadcrumbs you leave behind when you do anything online. I've learned, that this includes (and is not limited to) profiles such as Facebook and LinkedIn, Photographs of me or tagged photos (on Facebook) and basically, anything about me that is on the web - written, recorded, photographed, etc. I found out, that I am at a good starting point for my "digital footprint" by Googling my name, and only people with the same name as mine come up, but not me.
                                </p>
                                <p>One of the activities this week was to make a note of ways I can create a positive footprint and actions to take if I have a negative one. With the help of my "Digital Plan", I have managed to give myself the following advice:
                                <br>
                                <i>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Be more cautious about what you are writing on social media;</li>
                                        <li>Don’t put personal information online;</li>
                                        <li>Be more cautious with linked websites (logging in other websites using your Facebook Account or Google account) as they might take more information than required;</li>
                                        <li>Make sure everything you upload is shown to the right people, and not to those that do not need to see your information (Uploading photos that only Friends can see, Removing unnecessary information from LinkedIn, etc.)</li>
                                    </ul>
