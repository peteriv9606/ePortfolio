UWTSD(London) LDE - Assessment 1;

An electronic portfolio ( e-portfolio) is a representative compilation of my work completed weekly as part of the module "Learning in the Digital Era" (ACCA4025). 
It is meant to reflect my learning throughout the term, my struggles and my successes. 

I was asked to complete an e-portfolio which includes a reflective account to be created from eight weekly assignments completed during the term, and I chose to represent my work through a Website.
In the website, you can find all the required information on my assessment under the "Assessment" tab, 
or directly by choosing one of the weeks from the drop-down menu next to the "Assessment" tab, which are:

    (Week 1) - My digital Life;

    (Week 2) - Getting up and running (my digital environment);

    (Week 3) - Making my mark online;

    (Week 4) - Staying safe online;

    (Week 5) - Critical Consumption;

    (Week 6) - The right tool for the right job;

    (Week 7) - Being Digital and making it work for me;

    (Week 8) - Continuing my digital journey.

I used "Netlify" to host my website, as it's a free hosting website, with an unlimited time for hosting.
